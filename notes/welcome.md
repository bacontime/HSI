# Welcome to the Martel Company!

We are so glad to have you with us on this most
auspicious opportunity. You are a valued member of
our expedition and your hard work will not go
unforgotten nor **UNREWARDED!**

As mentioned during your orientation we at the
Martel Company have 3 goals in mind while stationed
here at Hot Springs Island:

1. Map the Island. Take notes, add to this
    guide. Valuable information will be rewarded,
    should you survive long enough to tell about
    it.
2. Retrieve any valuable relics or items. They
    will be purchased for a fair price at any
    Martel Supply Ship, which visit the island
    regularly.
3. Maintain positive relationships with the
    denizens of this Island. Be a good ambassador
    and represent the Martel company well! (As
    long as it doesn’t interfere with Points 1
    and 2).
4. We also hope you will befriend and
    collaborate with any other Martel Expeditions
    you encounter. After all we are all friends
    here, and all share the same mission! There
    are enough riches to go around.
    
Thank you for joining us on this grand adventure!
Please talk to your local Martel representative if
you need direction on where to go or what to do.
Good luck, and don’t forget to survive! You’re no
good to use dead.
